Currently for my visual rhetoric collage, I have a frame of the collage set up with the general location and styling of all the text I want on my piece. I am still waiting on my bananas to get rip so until that happens, I can't take the picture that is going to be my main centerpiece of my college. Currently, I am sourcing temporary pictures from online so I can still work in the faces that I'm going to be adding to the fruit. The only thing that I can't really work on right now is photo editing the fruit themselves since I don't have the picture yet.

So far, I've completed the art for the banana and then decided to add an apple and a strawberry as well. The plan is to have each fruit represent a different Instagram stereotype of people who over edit their pictures to set unrealistic expectations. The art I'm currently working on is the Instagram strawberry one, which I've only managed to get the line art done for, but the plan is to have that one represent the Asians who constantly have the big alien eye and pointy chin filter on. In the reality version, the strawberry will have two chins (which will be edited away in the Instagram one) and much smaller eyes while she is in the process of putting on her makeup.

I am still trying to decide on what exactly I'll be doing with the apple one and also the exact arrangement of the fruit in the picture. But I also think this will be something that I'll figure out when I get around to actually taking the picture. The only thing I'm worried right now about is having enough time to get all the fruits edited, but I think I should be okay.
